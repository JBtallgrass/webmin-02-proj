# Project Title: Module 2 Project

**Author:** [Jason Ballard](https://github.com/JBtallgrass)

## Overview
This project explores foundational Python programming techniques applied to data handling, basic statistics, and simple automation tasks in Jupyter Notebooks. The notebooks were developed as part of coursework in *Web Mining and Applied Natural Language Processing*, focusing on Python programming, data manipulation, and preparation for more advanced data mining and machine learning topics. Topics covered include arithmetic operations, list comprehensions, dictionary operations, basic statistical calculations, and pattern generation with nested loops.

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JBtallgrass/webmin-02-proj.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the notebooks in Jupyter to review the code and execute cells interactively.

## Data Sources
This project does not rely on external datasets. Instead, all data is generated or defined within the notebooks. This allows users to understand and interact with Python structures and functions in a self-contained environment.

## Methodology
Each notebook is structured with a clear sequence of tasks to guide the user through:
- **Understanding Core Concepts**: The notebooks emphasize basic Python concepts such as functions, loops, and data structures. Each task builds on previous ones to reinforce learning incrementally.
- **Statistical Computation**: The project includes tasks on calculating the mean and variance, essential for data analysis and statistical comprehension. Each statistical function is crafted to build familiarity with Python’s data handling capabilities.
- **Pattern Generation**: Using nested loops to create patterns helps in developing logical thinking and control over printed output. This has applications in both algorithm design and understanding visual data representation.
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Exercises are designed to be run interactively. Users are encouraged to modify parameters, try new input values, and observe changes in output, enhancing their understanding of Python behavior.

## Results
### Key Results and Insights
- **Basic Operations and Arithmetic**: Users can perform arithmetic operations with Python and understand how to display results with formatted text output.
- **Factorial Calculation**: A function to calculate factorials demonstrates iterative processes and the use of loops for calculation-heavy tasks.
- **Statistical Functions**: Mean and variance calculations are implemented to showcase basic data analysis. These functions lay the groundwork for more advanced analytics.
- **Data Structures**: Tasks involving list slicing, dictionary creation, and set operations allow users to manipulate and organize data efficiently.
- **Pattern Generation**: Nested loop usage helps users create specific visual patterns, which can be extended to more complex visualizations or algorithmic outputs.

## Export Options
To facilitate sharing and submission, both notebooks are set up to be exported to HTML format. The export can be achieved with the following commands:
   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to html python-ds.ipynb
   jupyter nbconvert --to html s574020.ipynb
   ```
Exported HTML files allow for a view-only experience of the notebooks, making them accessible without requiring a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Future Work
This project could be expanded in several ways:
- **Advanced Data Handling**: Incorporating tasks that use external data sources (like CSV files or databases) to introduce data import and export functionalities.
- **Enhanced Statistical Analysis**: Adding more complex statistical functions, such as standard deviation, median, and correlation calculations.
- **Pattern Complexity**: Increasing the complexity of pattern generation tasks to include shapes, symmetrical patterns, or even basic ASCII art, aiding algorithmic skills.
- **Automation and Scripting**: Turning certain functions into reusable scripts or Python modules that could be integrated into larger projects or used in real-world data analysis pipelines.
